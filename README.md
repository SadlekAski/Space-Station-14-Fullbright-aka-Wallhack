# Space-Station-14-Fullbright-aka-Wallhack
I will tell how to do a fullbright in space station 14 because I haven't found anything about it. Tutorial will be in Readme (Well its Readme already)
Keep in mind, I haven't found this, its not my way, I just found it on youtube and made it into this guide
Also keep in mind that it works at not all servers

I will use ss14 for short, which means space station 14
```
1. you gonna need cheat engine.
2. Choose ss14 proccess (NOT LAUNCHER)
3. You gotta use default cheat engine search settings which is
Value type: 4 Bytes
Scan Type: Exact Value
In Value you put: 16843009
Then press scan
4. After it scanned, you should change Addresses to "16843008" or to "0"
5. Do this until shadows will gone and you will see everything (Next steps are optional, but its better to do them), then better will be find which address does removes shadows by changing the value back to 16843009
6. After (Or when, whatever) you find it, add it to address list, and put a "Active" mark on it so it will stay this value forever
7. Change the value back to "16843008" or to "0"
```
```
Now these are optional
There are few fullbright types
You can be able to see everything in dark but not whatever behind the wall by changing 16843009 to: "15843009" this will enable Half-Fullbright
Also you can change 16843009 to "16842009" but I don't call this a fullbright/wallhack or Half-Fullbright or quarter-fullbright, cuz u just see doors and uhh I forgot name, some other things, that have glow parts
```
Also there is a program that do all this for you, but it can only be full fullbright

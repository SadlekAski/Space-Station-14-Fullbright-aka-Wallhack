1. To do so you have to first find the value that cuts off shadows and etc, you know how to do it from the tutorial
2. Choose it and press "F5" or right click it and press "Find out what accesses this address"
3. Make it active and change its value to "16843008" (if you haven't)
4. There should be a thing that keep increasing in value of used (You gonna see it appear and increase how much it was used if the value was at 16843009, and u changed it to 16843008 with its being active), When you find it go to step 5
